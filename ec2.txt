 If ec2 instance is in one region then the volumes attached to it are also in same availability zone
 
 if we want to move ec2-instance from one region to another, need to follow below steps->>
 1= take snapshot of the instance 
 2= copy that snapshot from that region to desired region
 3= now create the image of that copied (snapshot) volume
 4= now u can boot ec2 instance from that image 
 
 snapshot exists on s3
 
 volumes restored from encrypted volumes are also encrypted
 
 while taking the snapshot of root volume, first shutdown the instance 
 
 snapshots of encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted
 
 these snapshots can be shared with another aws accounts
 
 three types of load balancer
 
 1= application load balancer  -->> operate on layer 7
 2= network load balancer      -->> operate on layer 4
 3= elastic load balancer      -->> operate on layer 4 but can go on layer 7 using x forwarded IP
 
 there is no public IP for ELB only a DNS name
