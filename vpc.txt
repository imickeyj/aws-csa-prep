whenever we create a new VPC it by default create a new SG, route table, NACL 

you can not have multiple IGW for a VPC only one per VPC

Security Groups exist within the VPCs

when we create a VPC it by default creates a Route Table, but we cannot use that route table to provide intenet access to a subnet
so we create a another route table and add route to Newly activated internet Gateway (which get created when we built a new VPC)

create one webserver within PUBLIC Subnet and DB server within private subnet

after that create a security Group and open 3306, All ICMP ports to check ping connectivity, 

now we can ping a server within a private subnet from server within a public subnet

but that server within a private subnet doesnot have internet access (so we are not able to install anything like update patches)


NAT instance is still in use (still comes in exam), but people now use NAT gateway.

when creating a NAT instance keep in mind to disable source and destination check on intance

NAT instance must be in public subnet

amount of traffic NAT instance can support depends on instance size

NAT gateway automatically scales up to 10 GBs

AWS automatically assigns Public IPs to NAT Gateways
No need to patch and also not associated with security group

VPC automatically comes with NACL and by default allows all inbound and outbound traffic
but when we create custom NACL it by default denys all inbound and outbound traffic
one subnet is only associated with one NACL and one RT
allow ephimeral ports in NACL for outbound rules

we can block IP addresses using NACL not security groups

An IGW is provided by default in a default VPC, but not in a manually created VPC. A Public IP address is needed, and of the options provided an ElasticIP is the best option.  

 
deleting VPC 

first delete Internet gateway

subnets

route table

at last VPC



when we make igw attach it to VPC

after that there is default route table when we created a vpc, but we do not use it to route out to internet (otherwise both public and private subnet will be internet facing)
and we will create a new route table and route out traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 and assocate a subnet (that is going to be ppublic one)

ADDING A VOLUME IN EC2 INSTANCE

1= check using lsblk for new attached volume 

2= now make the file system ext3   sudo mkfs -t /dev/xvdf

3= create a directory for mounting new storage volume 

4=  mount new volume using command sudo mound /dev/sdf  /App

5= make an entry in /etc/fstab 

6= validate using df -h

 ADDING SWAP IN LINUX
 
  
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile count=4096 bs=1MiB
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

sudo nano /etc/fstab
add this line:

/swapfile   swap    swap    sw  0   0
